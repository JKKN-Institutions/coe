## Current Situation
```
❌ Error: Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
❌ Departments page won't load
❌ Table "departments" doesn't exist in database
```

## Solution (5 Minutes)

### 📋 **STEP 1: Open Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on your **JKKN COE project**
4. Look for **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
5. Click **SQL Editor**

---

### 📝 **STEP 2: Open the Migration File**

1. On your computer, navigate to:
   ```
   C:\Users\JKKN\Downloads\jkkn\coe\jkkncoe\supabase\migrations\
   ```

2. Open this file in Notepad or VS Code:
   ```
   20250103_create_departments_table.sql
   ```

3. Select ALL text (Ctrl+A)
4. Copy (Ctrl+C)

---

### ✅ **STEP 3: Run the Migration**

1. Back in Supabase **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New Query"** button (top right)
3. Paste the SQL code (Ctrl+V)
4. Click **"RUN"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)

**What you should see:**
```
Success. No rows returned
✅ Query completed successfully
```

**If you see an error**, take a screenshot and check the troubleshooting section below.

### 🧪 **STEP 4: Verify Table Created**

In the same SQL Editor, clear the previous query and run this:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'departments' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Click **RUN**.

**Expected result:** You should see 12 rows showing all columns:
- id (uuid)
- institutions_id (uuid)
- institution_code (character varying)
- department_code (character varying)
- department_name (character varying)
- display_name (character varying)
- description (text)
- stream (character varying)
- status (boolean)
- created_at (timestamp with time zone)
- updated_at (timestamp with time zone)
- created_by (uuid)
- updated_by (uuid)

✅ **If you see these 12 columns, SUCCESS! Table is created.**

---

### 🌐 **STEP 5: Test Your App**

1. Go back to your browser where the app is running
2. Press **F5** to refresh the page
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
4. Click on **"Departments"** in the sidebar

**What you should see NOW:**
```
✅ Page loads successfully
✅ Empty table with column headers
✅ "Add Department" button works
✅ No 404 errors in console
```

---

### 🎯 **STEP 6: Add Your First Department**

1. Click **"Add"** button (top right)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Institution Code**: Select from dropdown (e.g., JKKN)
   - **Department Code**: CSE
   - **Department Name**: Computer Science and Engineering
   - **Display Name**: CS
   - **Stream**: Engineering
   - **Status**: Active (toggle should be ON)

3. Click **"Create Department"**

**Expected result:**
```
✅ Success toast message appears
✅ Department appears in the table
✅ You can edit and delete it
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation 'institutions' does not exist"

**Cause:** The institutions table doesn't exist either.

**Fix:** Run this first:
```sql
-- Check if institutions table exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'institutions';
```

If it returns empty, you need to create the institutions table first. Check for an institutions migration file.

---

### Error: "permission denied for table departments"

**Cause:** RLS policy issue or authentication problem.

**Fix:** Make sure you're using the correct Supabase keys in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

Then restart your dev server:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

---

### Error: "could not execute query"

**Cause:** SQL syntax error or missing dependency.

**Fix:** 
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE migration file
3. Try running the diagnostic test instead (see below)

---

### Still Getting 404?

Run the diagnostic test:

1. Open this file: `test-departments-setup.sql`
2. Copy ALL contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**
5. Read the test results

This will tell you exactly what's wrong.

---

## 📱 Alternative: Use the Batch Script

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
cd C:\Users\JKKN\Downloads\jkkn\coe\jkkncoe
.\apply-departments-migration.bat
```

This will automatically apply the migration.
