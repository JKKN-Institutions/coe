# Scripts Directory

This directory is reserved for executable scripts that support the entity CRUD page builder skill.

## Purpose

Scripts in this directory are meant for tasks that require:
- Deterministic reliability
- Code that is repeatedly rewritten
- Performance-critical operations

## Potential Scripts

Future scripts that could be added here:

1. **generate-entity-page.js**: Script to scaffold a new entity CRUD page from a template
2. **validate-entity-schema.js**: Validate entity type definitions against database schema
3. **generate-api-routes.js**: Generate standardized API routes for an entity
4. **audit-page-consistency.js**: Check if existing entity pages follow the standard patterns

## Usage

Scripts should be executable and well-documented with:
- Clear purpose and usage instructions
- Input/output specifications
- Error handling
- Examples

## Note

Currently, this skill does not include executable scripts. The patterns are documented in SKILL.md and reference files. Scripts will be added as specific automation needs arise.
