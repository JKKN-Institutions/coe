6. Development Guidelines (Cursor & Claude Code)
6.1 AI-Assisted Development Strategy
6.1.1 Cursor IDE Integration

Code Generation Patterns:

javascript  // Use clear function signatures for Cursor autocomplete
  // Example: Internal test scheduling component
  interface InternalTestSchedule {
    testType: 'midSemester' | 'unit' | 'surprise' | 'remedial';
    department: string;
    semester: number;
    duration: number; // in minutes
    mode: 'online' | 'offline' | 'hybrid';
  }

Component Templates: Pre-defined templates for rapid development
AI Context Files: Maintain .cursorrules for project-specific patterns
Code Review Prompts: Standardized prompts for code optimization

6.1.2 Claude Code CLI Development

Automation Scripts:

bash  # Example: Generate examination module scaffolding
  claude-code generate-module --name="internal-exam" \
    --features="scheduling,evaluation,reporting" \
    --database="postgresql" \
    --api="rest"

Testing Automation: Automated test case generation
Database Migration Scripts: AI-generated migration files
API Documentation: Auto-generated OpenAPI specs

6.1.3 Development Best Practices

Module Isolation: Each examination type as independent module
Clear Interfaces: Well-defined APIs between modules
Type Safety: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
Documentation First: JSDoc comments for AI understanding
Test-Driven: Write test descriptions for AI to implement
